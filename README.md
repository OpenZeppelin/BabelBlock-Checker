## How to Use This Checklist

BabelBlk Checker is a comprehensive checklist designed for auditors evaluating the security, reliability, and maintainability of smart contract languages. It helps auditors systematically review aspects of a language that can impact the quality and security of the smart contracts developed with it.

This checklist is organized into distinct categories, each addressing a particular aspect of smart contract development. Each item includes explanations of the objectives and potential issues to help auditors understand the importance of each check.

To use the checklist effectively:
1. Review the categories and choose those relevant to your audit focus.
2. Check each item to understand the rationale and context.
3. Proceed through each item systematically to ensure a comprehensive review.

Auditors are encouraged to take notes while progressing through the checklist, as these notes can be valuable for communicating findings to stakeholders and for creating detailed audit reports. BabelBlk Checker can also be used iteratively—returning to the checklist during different stages of the audit can help confirm that all issues are addressed.

## Acknowledgment of Influence

The structure of BabelBlk Checker has been partially inspired by the [**Smart Contract Security Verification Standard (SCSVS)**](https://github.com/ComposableSecurity/SCSVS). Although SCSVS is tailored for auditing smart contracts, while BabelBlk Checker focuses on the languages used to create those contracts, the systematic and organized approach is similar. This acknowledgment reflects how SCSVS's clear, category-driven format has influenced the structure of this checklist, aiming to provide auditors with a reliable framework for evaluating smart contract languages.
