# Runtime Safety and Performance

## Description

The **Runtime Safety and Performance** category focuses on the operational aspects of smart contracts during execution. It ensures that the language and its compiler generate efficient and secure code that performs reliably on the blockchain platform. Key considerations include correct gas charging to prevent denial-of-service attacks and unnecessary costs, optimization of contract size to meet platform constraints, and efficient memory management to avoid resource exhaustion or leaks. Additionally, this category emphasizes the importance of safe compiler optimizations that do not introduce unexpected behaviors or vulnerabilities.

This section helps auditors assess the language's ability to produce performant and safe contracts, ensuring that they operate reliably and efficiently in the blockchain environment.
