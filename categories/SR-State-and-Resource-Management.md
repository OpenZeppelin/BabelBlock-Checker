# State and Resource Management

## Description

The **State and Resource Management** category focuses on how the language handles the management of state and resources within smart contracts. It ensures that the language provides mechanisms to prevent issues such as race conditions, inconsistent state, and storage collisions, especially in the context of concurrent executions and contract upgrades. By offering primitives for concurrent state update management, atomic transactions, and consistent storage layout, the language helps maintain the integrity and reliability of contracts over time. Additionally, this category considers the language's support for upgradeable contracts and efficient state management practices, which are essential for long-term maintenance and performance optimization.

This section assists auditors in evaluating the language's ability to manage state and resources effectively, ensuring that contracts remain secure, consistent, and efficient throughout their lifecycle.
