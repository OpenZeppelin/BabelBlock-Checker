# Security Features

## Description

The **Security Features** category focuses on the intrinsic security mechanisms provided by the smart contract language. It ensures that the language includes built-in protections against common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, and predictable randomness. By offering these safeguards, the language helps developers write secure code by default, reducing reliance on individual awareness and minimizing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities. This category also covers the language's ability to prevent exploitation through buffer overflows, dependency hijacking, and type-related issues.

This section aids auditors in assessing the language's robustness in providing essential security features for safe and reliable smart contract development.

| SF-001     | Built-in Reentrancy Protection             | Check if the language provides built-in reentrancy protection mechanisms to prevent reentrancy attacks and enhance contract security. Validate if the implementation works properly. | <ul><li>Reentrancy attacks causing fund loss</li><li>Dependence on developer awareness</li><li>Common security pitfalls</li></ul> |
| SF-002     | Integer Overflow/Underflow Protection      | Ensure the language provides built-in mechanisms to prevent integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities, maintaining contract integrity and security. | <ul><li>Financial exploits via integer overflow/underflow</li><li>Contract integrity compromise</li><li>Loss of funds</li></ul> |
| SF-003     | Secure Random Number Generation            | Ensure the language offers secure random number generation primitives to prevent exploits due to predictable or manipulable randomness.                  | <ul><li>Exploits from predictable randomness</li><li>Manipulation of random-dependent logic</li><li>Unfair execution</li></ul> |
| SF-004     | Array Bounds Checking Enforcement          | Ensure the language enforces proper array bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities and unauthorized memory access.                    | <ul><li>Buffer overflow vulnerabilities</li><li>Unauthorized memory access</li><li>Security breaches</li></ul> |
| SF-005     | Protection Against Dependency Hijacking    | Ensure the language ecosystem provides protection against dependency hijacking to prevent malicious code inclusion.                                      | <ul><li>Malicious code introduction</li><li>Backdoors in contracts</li><li>Compromised security</li><li>Trust issues</li></ul> |
| SF-006     | Type-Related Vulnerability Safeguards      | Ensure the language provides safeguards against common type-related vulnerabilities, such as type confusion and unsafe type casting, to improve security and reliability. | <ul><li>Type confusion vulnerabilities</li><li>Exploitation via unsafe type casting</li><li>Reduced contract reliability due to type issues</li></ul> |
