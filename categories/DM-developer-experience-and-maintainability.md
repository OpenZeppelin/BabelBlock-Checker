# Developer Experience and Maintainability

## Description

The **Developer Experience and Maintainability** category focuses on the tools and practices that support developers in writing, debugging, and maintaining smart contracts. This includes ensuring that the language provides adequate debugging tools, up-to-date and consistent documentation, and encourages proper commenting practices. By facilitating an efficient development process and promoting code clarity, the language helps reduce the likelihood of errors and vulnerabilities. Additionally, mechanisms for auditing and verifying dependencies are crucial for maintaining overall contract security, especially when integrating third-party code.

This section assists auditors in evaluating how the language supports developers in creating secure, maintainable, and high-quality smart contracts.
